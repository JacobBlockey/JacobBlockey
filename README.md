Hello! I am Jacob Blockey
  
  I am a fresh graduate of Computer Science from North Hennepin Community College. I have an Associate of Science Degree with a major in Computer science, I have A certificate of application Programming, as well as a certificate of Object Oriented Programming. Some career goals of mine are: to become a skilled Software Engineer/Developer, become an invaluable asset to the company I work for, and to be respected amongst my peers for my knowledge.
  
  Seeing as I am a fresh graduate out of college, I do not have much professional experience yet besides my time so far here at Revature. So far at Revature I have done 3 projects, one of which was a group project creating a Salesforce Org for a made-up company my team and I came up with. I had a positive experience within my team helping to delegate tasks, as well as doing a lot of paired-programming to help my teammates squish some bugs they were having issues with. 
  
  During my time at North Hennepin Community College I learned a lot about Java, SQL, C#, and other Object Oriented Programming Languages, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my time here at Revature I have done a lot of work with Apex, Visualforce, and I'm now just starting to work with Aura components. One thing I pride myself in a lot is my ability to be "coachable", I learn really fast and whenever I make a mistake it is highly unlikely I'll ever make it again. I am Dependable, and Reliable and I have a strong work ethic.
  
  During that group project that I mentioned before I took the role of managing the Kanban board and making sure everyone (including myself) where doing the tasks they signed up for and made sure that the requirements everyone was doing wasn't going to overlap on someone else's work. I pride myself in my ability to come up with solutions to difficult problems quickly and efficiently. I exceed when I can bounce ideas off of a teammate, especially when theres a complex bug in code I'm good at finding the issue with my teammate. I am confident in my presentation skills, communication skills, and teamplayer skills, I feel like I excel in those environments. 


Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! Reach out to me if you need any help in coding/software development.
